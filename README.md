# Gaussian_Boson_Sampling_MSci_Project

Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS) is a limited form of a photonic quantum computer
that was employed in recent quantum supremacy claims. The GBS output draws from a
complex distribution pattern which is exponentially difficult to simulate on classical computers.
In this study, we utilise a fully classical GBS algorithm as an instrument to assess the
information-carrying capabilities of the low-order marginals of the distribution. We devise and
construct three types of noise models onto GBS simulations, which are statistically compared
against the classical algorithm output. We provide evidence that neglecting the high-order correlation
in GBS is equivalent to the introduction of noise, as well as establish high-order photon
interference as a potential source of high-order correlations. An application of this investigation
is presented in the form of a classical algorithm inspired by GBS that speeds up the search for
the densest subgraph problem.
